## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point for the bot. It should start the bot."),
    ("binance_api.py", "Implements the Binance API. It should have methods to get the price of the SOL token and execute trades."),
    ("bitfinex_api.py", "Implements the Bitfinex API. It should have methods to get the price of the SOL token and execute trades."),
    ("trader.py", "Contains the logic for monitoring prices and executing arbitrage trades. It should use the Binance and Bitfinex APIs."),
    ("notifier.py", "Sends notifications to the user. It should be used by the trader to notify the user when a trade has been executed."),
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "binance_api.py",
    "bitfinex_api.py",
    "trader.py",
    "notifier.py",
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The '.env' file contains sensitive information such as API keys. It should be used by the Binance and Bitfinex APIs to authenticate requests.

The 'apscheduler' library is used to schedule tasks in Python. It should be used by the main.py file to start the bot and by the trader.py file to continuously monitor prices.

The 'logging' library is used for logging the bot's activities and any errors that may occur. It should be used by all files.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. However, the actual implementation may require handling additional complexities such as handling API rate limits, error handling, and ensuring secure management of API keys.
