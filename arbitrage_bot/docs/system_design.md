## Implementation approach
The bot will be implemented using Python and will make use of the following open-source libraries:

1. `requests`: For making HTTP requests to the Binance and Bitfinex APIs.
2. `ccxt`: A cryptocurrency trading library with support for more than 100 bitcoin/altcoin exchanges. It will be used to interact with the Binance and Bitfinex APIs for fetching price data and executing trades.
3. `apscheduler`: For scheduling tasks in Python. It will be used to continuously monitor the price of the SOL token on both exchanges.
4. `logging`: For logging the bot's activities and any errors that may occur.
5. `python-dotenv`: To manage API keys and other sensitive information.

The bot will continuously fetch the price of the SOL token on both exchanges and calculate the price difference. If the price difference exceeds a certain threshold (which can be set by the user), the bot will execute trades on both platforms to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity. The bot will also log its activities and send notifications to the user when a trade has been executed.

## Python package name
```python
"arbitrage_bot"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "binance_api.py",
    "bitfinex_api.py",
    "trader.py",
    "notifier.py",
    ".env"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid

    class Main{
        +void start_bot()
    }
    class BinanceAPI{
        +float get_price()
        +void execute_trade(float amount)
    }
    class BitfinexAPI{
        +float get_price()
        +void execute_trade(float amount)
    }
    class Trader{
        +void monitor_prices()
        +void execute_arbitrage_trade()
    }
    class Notifier{
        +void send_notification(string message)
    }
    Main -- Trader : uses
    Trader -- BinanceAPI : uses
    Trader -- BitfinexAPI : uses
    Trader -- Notifier : uses
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant T as Trader
    participant B as BinanceAPI
    participant F as BitfinexAPI
    participant N as Notifier
    M->>T: start_bot()
    loop every x seconds
        T->>B: get_price()
        T->>F: get_price()
        T->>T: calculate_price_difference()
        alt price difference > threshold
            T->>B: execute_trade(amount)
            T->>F: execute_trade(amount)
            T->>N: send_notification("Trade executed")
        end
    end
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. However, the actual implementation may require handling additional complexities such as handling API rate limits, error handling, and ensuring secure management of API keys.
